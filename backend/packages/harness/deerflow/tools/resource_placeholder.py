"""Canonical model-visible placeholder text for MCP resource links.

Both the MCP conversion layer (``deerflow.mcp.tools``) and the read-time
``ModelContentCompatibilityMiddleware`` downgrade resource references that a
chat model cannot consume into a short text placeholder. They share this
formatter so a thread healed at read time shows the model the exact same
placeholder shape a fresh conversion would have produced. Persisted content
blocks carry no resource name, so the name segment is optional and simply
omitted when absent.

    - virtual paths carry no host-path risk and stay visible — but only the
      exact virtual root or a slash-delimited descendant: a sibling like
      ``/mnt/user-data-backups/...`` shares the prefix yet is a real host
      path, so it must collapse to ``None`` like any other host location;
      remote schemes (``http(s)``, ``ui://``, ``s3://``, ...) stay visible;
    - a raw ``file://`` URI, a bare host path, or a Windows drive path
      (urlparse reads the drive letter as a single-character scheme) leaks the
      deployment's filesystem layout, so it collapses to ``None`` and the
      placeholder omits the location segment (US-16);
    - ``data:`` URIs embed their whole base64 payload and ``blob:`` URIs name a
      browser-local object nothing else can dereference, so they collapse to
      ``None`` too — inlining either would put kilobytes-to-megabytes of
      base64 into the model-visible text.
